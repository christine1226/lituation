Lituation was created with Ruby on Rails from frontend to backend.

Lituation is an app for users to be able to post events that they are hosting or know of and also be able to look through a newsfeed of events going on in NYC posted by other users.

**Running The Application**
- First, you'll want to clone this repository.
- Next, you'll want to run a  `bundle install` and  `rails db:migrate`
- Then, you will want to run `rails s` 
- Finally, your server will be running. If your browser doesnt open on its own to the app, you can go to your browser and type in `http://localhost:3000/` and you be able to user the Lituations app from your browser.If your server isn't running on 3000, you can check your command line and replace 3000 with whatever server you are running on.
